Xi Transliterator
==================

About
------

Simple transliterator abstraction for PHP. To used by, for example, slugifiers.

At this stage it's meant to transliterate weirdo Roman alphabety languages with umlauts and other evil
characters to non-evil (sluggable) strings. More may follow.

Supports:

- Stupid transliterator for dev / people with no suitable PHP extension
- PECL transliterator. Does not seem to work with Macs.
- Intl transliterator. Hardcore.
